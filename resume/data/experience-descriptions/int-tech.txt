Work consisted in the development of ALL, which is connected with the web. In the first month I developed a multi-threaded parser and collect about 2TB of data. Then the decision was agreed with the management to completely switch to the front to develop the SPA. Stack was elected React + Redux. But after a while, the management could not provide data to complete the project and it was decided to suspend development, and my task included writing parsers on JS (node.js).
