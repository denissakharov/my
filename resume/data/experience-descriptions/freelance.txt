Developed sites, which is a shame to show. Almost immediately began working in a team of two people, later hooked up the third. The first developer was much more experienced than me and it gave its results - we took the second project, then the third, then the fourth. The fourth project (kaspado.ru) turned out to be much larger and longer than expected, and there was no longer any money left to complete the project, so I decided to get a job.
